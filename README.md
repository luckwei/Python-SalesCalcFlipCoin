# Python-Projects
Here, I will be uploading the projects that I have worked on. Projects includes raw python as well as it's library like PyGame, TensorFlow, PyTorch, web2py,etc.

1. First Project:(Higest and Lowest Sale calculation based application)
To understand what this program is in detail, read this description.

Create a basic python console application to calculate and display coffee beans sales for N customers who purchased coffee beans from Australian roasters. The prices of coffee beans bags are shown below

Quantity                      Price (including tax)
1-3 bags                      $38 per bag
3-10bags                     $35.5 per bag
more than 10 bags      $33.7 per bag

Specific Requirements:
1.  The application should ask the user to enter the customer name, the number of coffee bags, and yes or no to indicate whether the customer is a reseller. The reseller customers receive a 10% discount on their orders no matter how many coffee bags they purchase.
2. Assume that the quantity (number of coffee bags) is an integer type with the range between 1 and 100. An error message should be issued if a user enters a value beyond this range and the re-entering is required.
3. The program makes a calculation of the order and displays the result of customer details and the total price as shown below. The program should be kept running with entering the next set of input data.
4. After all N sets of input data are entered from the keyboard, your program will also display the information that includes the customer spending most, the customer spending least as shown in a attached figure.
5. The application should be user-friendly by displaying appropriate welcome, exit and error message.
